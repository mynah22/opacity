        <font size=3><br>Opacity is an open source implementation of the Rijndael cipher (the Advanced Encryption Standard).<br>
                         It was written as a political statement to western governments that are seeking to obtain the 
                         ability to decrypt 'all' communications and data.<br> <br>Opacity is proof of this task's impossibility.<br>
                         <br>
                         I am a high-school dopout with no education in computer programming, formal or otherwise. This program was created using open source libraries, and 
                         python standard library documentation. With this software, it is possible to encrypt data in such a way that it makes decryption without the key near
                         impossible (see math). There is nothing special about this software, or it's creator. ANYONE CAN DO THIS. No security is gained by allowing governments to see into the pivate data streams of their citizens, as anyone with the desire to obfuscate their data can do so easily, by either using pre-made tools like this one, or by rolling their own.

                         Disclaimer:<br>This program in it's current form is not written to be a secure solution for data encryption (although once encrypted the data is very secure). It was not written to be compatible with other AES implementations. It was not written to be bug free (and has known issues). Use of opacity as a primary encryption tool is strongly discouraged. Use as an educational tool, modification, and forking are all highly encouraged. (see license)
